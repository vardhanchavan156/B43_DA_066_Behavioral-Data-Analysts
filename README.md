# Flight Fare Estimator

## 📌 Overview
The **Flight Fare Estimator** is a Streamlit-based dashboard that helps users analyze and predict flight ticket prices based on various factors such as airline, travel class, origin, destination, date, and more. It provides interactive visualizations and insights to aid in better decision-making.

## 🚀 Features
- **Flight Price Prediction**: Estimate flight fares based on key parameters.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Pie charts, bar charts, histograms, and box plots for deep analysis.
- **Filters & Selections**: Users can select airlines, destinations, travel classes, and more.
- **Scalability & Performance**: Optimized queries and caching for faster results.
- **Security Measures**: Input validation, data encryption, and secure API access.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Interactive dashboard framework.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly**: Advanced data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models for fare prediction.
